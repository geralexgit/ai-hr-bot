# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for transforming the existing basic Telegram HR bot into a comprehensive **AI HR Bot SaaS Platform**. The system will operate as a multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service platform where each customer (HR organization) has their own isolated environment with:

- **Individual User Dashboard**: Each customer gets a personalized web dashboard for managing their recruitment operations
- **Custom Telegram Bot Integration**: Each customer can connect their own Telegram bot token to create a branded recruitment bot
- **Configurable LLM Processing**: Each customer can select and configure their preferred Large Language Model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) for candidate analysis
- **Complete Data Isolation**: Each customer's data (vacancies, candidates, evaluations) is completely isolated from other customers
- **Subscription-Based Access**: The platform operates on a subscription model with different tiers and usage-based billing

The platform will manage recruitment workflows with PostgreSQL database integration, structured candidate evaluation, vacancy management, audio processing capabilities, and comprehensive user account management.
