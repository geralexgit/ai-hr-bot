# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for transforming the existing basic Telegram HR bot into a comprehensive **AI HR Bot SaaS Platform**. The system will operate as a multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service platform where each user has their own isolated environment with personal dashboard, custom Telegram bot integration, and configurable LLM processing. The platform will manage recruitment workflows with PostgreSQL database integration, structured candidate evaluation, vacancy management, audio processing capabilities, and personalized user dashboards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Integration and Data Management

**User Story:** As an HR manager, I want candidate interactions and vacancy data to be persistently stored in a structured database, so that I can track recruitment progress and maintain historical records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish a connection to PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN a candidate interacts with the bot THEN the system SHALL store all dialogue data in the database
3. WHEN a vacancy is created THEN the system SHALL store vacancy details with configurable evaluation criteria and weights
4. WHEN candidate responses are analyzed THEN the system SHALL store structured evaluation results linked to the candidate and vacancy
5. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and attempt reconnection with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2: Vacancy Management System

**User Story:** As an HR manager, I want to create and manage job vacancies with specific requirements and evaluation criteria, so that candidates can be systematically evaluated against standardized criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HR manager creates a vacancy THEN the system SHALL store job title, description, requirements, and evaluation weights
2. WHEN a candidate starts the bot THEN the system SHALL present active vacancies as interactive buttons
3. WHEN a candidate selects a vacancy THEN the system SHALL initiate a structured interview process for that specific role
4. WHEN evaluation criteria are defined THEN the system SHALL support configurable weights for technical skills, communication, and problem-solving
5. IF no active vacancies exist THEN the system SHALL inform candidates that no positions are currently available

### Requirement 3: Structured Candidate Evaluation

**User Story:** As an HR manager, I want candidate responses to be systematically analyzed against vacancy requirements with scoring and recommendations, so that I can make informed hiring decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a candidate provides responses THEN the system SHALL analyze them against specific vacancy requirements
2. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a structured report with percentage match, strengths, gaps, and recommendation
3. WHEN scoring is calculated THEN the system SHALL apply configurable weights (technical skills 50%, communication 30%, problem-solving 20%)
4. WHEN contradictions are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them in the evaluation report
5. WHEN evaluation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide one of three recommendations: Proceed, Reject, or Clarify

### Requirement 4: Audio Message Processing

**User Story:** As a candidate, I want to send voice messages during the interview process, so that I can communicate more naturally and the system can evaluate my verbal communication skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a candidate sends an audio message THEN the system SHALL convert it to text using speech-to-text processing
2. WHEN audio is processed THEN the system SHALL store both the original audio file and the transcription
3. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL analyze the text content for evaluation
4. WHEN audio processing fails THEN the system SHALL inform the candidate and request a text response
5. IF audio quality is poor THEN the system SHALL request clarification or alternative input method

### Requirement 5: Personalized Candidate Feedback

**User Story:** As a candidate, I want to receive specific feedback about my responses and clear next steps, so that I understand my application status and areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN candidate evaluation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate personalized feedback highlighting strengths and improvement areas
2. WHEN feedback is delivered THEN the system SHALL provide clear next steps (proceed, rejection with explanation, or clarification needed)
3. WHEN technical gaps are identified THEN the system SHALL provide specific examples of missing skills
4. WHEN communication issues are detected THEN the system SHALL offer constructive suggestions
5. IF additional information is needed THEN the system SHALL ask specific follow-up questions

### Requirement 6: Admin Panel Integration

**User Story:** As an HR manager, I want a web-based admin panel to manage vacancies, review candidate evaluations, and track recruitment pipeline, so that I can efficiently oversee the hiring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HR manager accesses the admin panel THEN the system SHALL provide vacancy management capabilities
2. WHEN viewing candidate reports THEN the system SHALL display structured evaluation results with scores and recommendations
3. WHEN managing recruitment pipeline THEN the system SHALL allow status updates and candidate progression tracking
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide vacancy statistics and decision-making history
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 7: System Integration and API Design

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all components to communicate through well-defined APIs, so that the system is maintainable and can be extended with additional features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components communicate THEN the system SHALL use standardized JSON API formats
2. WHEN data is exchanged THEN the system SHALL validate input and handle errors gracefully
3. WHEN services are deployed THEN the system SHALL support independent scaling of components
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and error tracking
5. IF a service becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a data protection officer, I want candidate data to be securely handled and stored, so that we comply with privacy regulations and protect sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN candidate data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication and authorization
3. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections
4. WHEN access is granted THEN the system SHALL log all data access for audit purposes
5. IF data breach is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately alert administrators and secure the system
